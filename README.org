* Summary
  Some spikes to evaluate different approaches for building GUIs with Clojure.
  The different approaches can be found in corresponding subfolders.

* Evaluation Requirements
  - The application should have a dialog to import a local csv file.
  - The csv file should get imported (needs to be all numerical data)
  - The file contents should get rendered in a table.
  - The data from the file gets rendered as a scatter plot, first column as x-values, each additional
    column as y-values.
